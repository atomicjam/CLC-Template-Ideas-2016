		<p>To celebrate our landmark 160th anniversary, we are undertaking various projects to highlight the legacy of this extraordinary institution.  These projects have brought together pupils, Guild and staff in shared tribute to our distinctive values and atmosphere.</p>
		<p>This particular project brings together the collection of items, places and even animals that make up 'College in 100 Objects'. Our grateful thanks go out to all those who have shared their stories in order to create this compilation of treasured memories; there were many more submitted than we could use. I do hope that you find this collection as interesting, varied, rich and evocative as I do. </p>

		      <p>The amphitheatre was built in the Quad with funds donated by Guild. Fifty tonnes of stone, the original Quadrangle cobblestones and four cube crown quercus trees were used in the building project. Mrs Mary Blackburn, Chairman of Guild, opened it on 8 May 2004.</p>
		      <p>"When I arrived at College, it had only recently been built and the Queen then unveiled a plaque in that quad in the first year I was here. In my time here, it has been used as a playground for Lower College break, somewhere to take group photos and somewhere for musicians to perform. It is also very good at collecting rainwater!"</p>

The Department stores a wealth of historic items, from Victorian science slides, through to original registers taken in class, to trunks, uniform, CLC china, Miss Beale's writing desk, photographs of staff, and far more. The Archives Department truly reflects the spirit, history and essence of College during its lifetime."</p>

Girls and staff here before photocopying became common will remember:</p>
		      <p>The smell of the banda fluid - as soon as you received your sheet you sniffed it and, if it had just been run off, it was still wet and smelt of the fluid so you were lucky - wonderful! There was no health and safety in those days!</p>
		      <p>Staff will remember purple fingers from the "carbon" sheet, which you had to fix into the Banda (it often took many tries to get it right as you would put the master on the drum the wrong way round and print onto the drum not the paper!), or from the newly run off sheets.</p>
		      <p>If you made a mistake on the master, you had to cross it out or start again!</p>
		      <p>If we were lucky, we were able to produce multi-coloured sheets by slipping in another coloured "carbon" sheet for diagrams.</p>
		      <p>When photocopying became commonplace in the 80s, I remember being told as a member of staff that we should use bandas as much as possible as it was cheaper than photocopying."</p>

This art studio was the territory of the sixth form only, and was presided over by Mrs August, Head of Department in my time. I spent a good proportion of my time there both painting for my A level, and studying my other subjects. It was a private space in a large school, and mine. An amusing incident (at least I thought so!) was when Miss Hampshire was taking the Fire Officer around the building, and, I subsequently learned, clearly having difficulty convincing him that the place was safe. They were in the room before I could retrieve my cassette tape player which was playing Pink Floyd at some volume. The machine was plugged into a power point on the opposite wall, quite some distance. This had necessitated in 2 joins in the lead which I had carefully achieved by joining the wires securely, and then binding with Elastoplast as I had no insulation tape. The Fire Officer's face was memorable, and Miss Hampshire went purple.... I retrieved the player from Miss Hampshire on the day I left, with some difficulty. I was embarrassed to have caused trouble to Mrs August who was great fun, and an inspiring teacher."</p>

			<h1>DOROTHEA BEALE'S DESK</h1>
			<p>"Miss Beale’s desk was placed on a dais so that she could supervise all the teaching that was taking place. The design also incorporated metal runners so that she could easily push the desk out to go and speak to anybody in the hall if she thought that something required her immediate attention. It was popularly known throughout the College as her ‘throne’ and, as such, was a symbol of her lengthening ‘reign’ as Principal which inevitably invited comparison with that of Queen Victoria’s reign over her empire.</p>
			<p>An original photograph of 1876 shows us that a tall wooden canopy over the desk gave the space some authoritative grandeur. In 1883, an organ was built above the desk to celebrate Miss Beale’s silver wedding to College and, as a result, this original wooden canopy over the ‘throne’ had to be altered so that the pipes could be fitted above it. At around this time curtains were hung either side of the dais to protect the occupant from draughts and to provide a degree of privacy. Portions of these curtains (made from William Morris’s bird pattern fabric) still survive in the Council Room and the Archives Display Room today."</p>
